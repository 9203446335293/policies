    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains the collection, use, and
      disclosure of "personal information" by Creative Commons, a
      Massachusetts Corporation, with its principal place of business
      at 543 Howard Street, San Francisco, 94150, USA, through the
      websites that Creative Commons operates at
      http:///creativecommons.org and http://sciencecommons.org
      ("Websites"). Any "personal information" that Creative Commons
      collects via our ccMixter site (http://ccmixter.org) is handled
      in accordance with our ccMixter Privacy Policy
      (http://ccmixter.org/privacy). As used in this policy, "personal
      information’ means information that would allow a party to
      identify you, such as, for example, your name, address,
      telephone number or email address.  Personal information we
      collect: We collect personal information at four places on our
      Websites: (1) in connection with your selection of one of our
      licenses, your selection of a Public Domain Dedication or your
      application for Founder’s Copyright; (2) when you provide us
      with your personal information such as by sending an email to us
      or signing up to receive a newsletter; (3) when you subscribe to
      one of our email discussion lists
      (http://creativecommons.org/discuss); and, (4) when you donate
      money to us or purchase merchandise via our support page
      (http://creativecommons.org/support/).</p>

    <p>What we do with the personal information we collect: We use the
    personal information you provide to us as part of your selection
    of one of our licenses to provide you the RDF, html, and the
    Uniform Resource Locator that corresponds to the license you
    selected. Your email address is expunged from our logs after this
    email has been successfully sent. If you choose a Public Domain
    Dedication, we use your personal information to provide you with
    the dedication information and your email address and other
    information is expunged from our logs after this email has been
    successfully sent. If you apply for a Founder’s Copyright, we use
    and retain your personal information to provide you with the
    relevant agreement, to process your application and manage your
    Founder’s Copyright.</p>

    <p>We use the personal information you provide to us when you send
    us emails or sign up to receive our newsletter in order to respond
    to your request, for example, to reply to your email or to send
    you communications about news and events related to Creative
    Commons.</p>

    <p>When you subscribe to our newsletter or to one of our email
    discussion lists, your name and email address is sent to and
    stored by ibiblio (http://www.ibiblio.org/), a collaboration
    between the Center for the Public Domain
    (http://www.centerforthepublicdomain.org/) and the University of
    North Carolina – Chapel Hill (http://www.unc.edu/). Personal
    information submitted as part of our email discussion lists is
    used for the purpose managing the discussion lists. Your name and
    email address will typically be visible to other list participants
    when you correspond on the list and to the general public in the
    discussion archives.</p>

    <p>When you donate money to us or purchase merchandise via our
    support page, your personal information will be handled in one of
    three ways, depending on which option you choose.</p>

    <p>If you purchase a t-shirt or other merchandise via the Café
    Press Creative Commons store, your personal information will be
    sent to, handled and stored by Café Press
    (http://www.cafepress.com/cp/info/) in accordance with its Terms
    of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>If you purchase a t-shirt or other merchandise directly from
    Creative Commons, we will use your personal information for the
    purpose of sending you the items you purchased.</p>

    <p>You may donate money to Creative Commons either via PayPal (in
    which case your personal information is sent to, handled by and
    stored by PayPal (https://www.paypal.com/) in accordance with its
    Terms of Use and Privacy Policy), via the Amazon Honor System (in
    which case your personal information is sent to, handled by and
    stored by Amazon.com (http://www.amazon.com) in accordance with
    its Conditions of Use and Privacy Policy) or directly to Creative
    Commons. When you donate money to Creative Commons directly, we
    use your personal information to process your donation.</p>

    <p>Regardless of the method by which you donate to Creative
    Commons or purchase a t-shirt or other merchandise, we
    additionally use the personal information you provide for the
    purpose of contacting you about upcoming news and events relevant
    to Creative Commons. When we contact you for the first time after
    your donation, we will give you the option to choose not to be
    contacted in this manner again. When you donate money as part of
    one of Creative Commons fundraising campaigns, your name will be
    published on our "supporters page" unless you request
    otherwise.</p>

    <p>Non-personal browsing and site usage information that we
    collect: When you use the Websites, our servers (which may be
    hosted by a third party service provider) may collect information
    indirectly and automatically (through, for example, the use of
    your "IP address") about your activities while visiting the
    Websites, including the web pages you view and the times you view
    them and information about the browser you are using. We do not
    link browsing information to the personal information you submit
    to us; we use this browsing information for internal purposes such
    as to help understand how the Websites are being used and to
    improve it, and for systems administration purposes. An IP address
    is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when
    you use the Internet. In some cases your IP address stays the same
    from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer
    Internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from
    session to session.</p>

    <p>The disclosures we may make of personal information: In
    general, it is not Creative Commons' practice to disclose personal
    information to third parties. We may share personal information in
    two instances.</p>

    <p>Firstly, Creative Commons may share personal information with
    our contractors and service providers in order to maintain,
    enhance, or add to the functionality of the Websites. Secondly, we
    may share personal information with third parties such as the
    government or other entities when required to by law or as
    required by court order.</p>

    <p>The security of personal information collected via the
    Websites: Creative Commons has implemented reasonable measures to
    protect against unauthorized access to and unlawful interception
    or processing of personal information that Creative Commons stores
    and controls. However, no website can fully eliminate security
    risks. Third parties may circumvent our security measures to
    unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private
    communications. We will post a reasonably prominent notice to the
    Websites if any such security breach occurs.</p>

    <p>Questions? If you have questions about this Privacy Policy,
    please contact us by email at info@creativecommons.org.</p>

    <p>We hope this policy clarifies our procedures regarding your
    personal information. Creative Commons may revise this policy at
    any time by updating this posting.</p>
